The tree is built out of tagged elements and strings.<div class="note"><p>Markup was originally developed in Lisp where the obvious representation for a Markup document is as s-expressions, with each tree represented by a list whose first element is a symbol indicating the treeâ€™s tag.</p><pre>(:body
  (:h1 "This is a header")
  (:p "This is a paragraph")
  (:p "This is another paragraph with some" (:i "italic") " text in it."))</pre></div> The abstract syntax tree is rooted in a single element whose tag is <span class="code">body</span>. Its children are the elements described below.</p></body></html>
